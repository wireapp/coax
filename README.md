# Coax

*A (barely working) native Wire GUI client for Unix*

In here you find the source code of Coax, a native client for Wire. The
repository consists of a single Cargo workspace which contains several
libraries which may or may not be useful individually. Together they
form a client with a GTK+ UI for Unix-like operating systems.


## Build instructions

Building the whole client depends on recent versions of

- Rust nightly + Cargo
- libsodium
- sqlite
- Gtk+
- OpenSSL

On startup a configuration file `coax.toml` is written to
`$HOME/.config/coax/`.

Assuming that you have all non-Rust dependencies installed, you can build
the client (nightly toolchain required):

    $ rustup override set nightly-2018-04-10
    $ cargo build

To run it, do `cd coax-gtk` and then either `cargo run` to just run the
client, or `make install` to install it as a desktop application.


## Motivation

This client is meant to be hackable with a small and (hopefully) easy to
understand code base written in a compiled language (Rust). It may be
useful for testing purposes. It can not replace any of the existing Wire
clients. Its feature set is currently severely limited and basically just
allows for sending and receiving text messages.


## Features

Not much is supported right now. In particular this client is currently
**NOT SECURE**. There is no TLS cerificate pinning, nor is it possible
to compare identity keys.

- [x] Receive messages
- [x] Send messages
- [ ] Everything else


## Outline

This workspace consists of the following libaries:

**[coax-net](https://github.com/wireapp/coax/tree/master/coax-net)**:
Basic networking support (e.g. TLS connections) plus a tiny subset of
HTTP/1.1.

**[coax-ws](https://github.com/wireapp/coax/tree/master/coax-ws)**:
Implements a subset of RFC 6455 (websocket protocol).

**[coax-data](https://github.com/wireapp/coax/tree/master/coax-data)**:
Storage support based on SQLite.

**[coax-api](https://github.com/wireapp/coax/tree/master/coax-api)**:
Wire API types with JSON serialisation.

**[coax-api-proto](https://github.com/wireapp/coax/tree/master/coax-api-proto)**:
Protocol buffers API corresponding to Wire's
[generic-message-proto](https://github.com/wireapp/generic-message-proto).

**[coax-client](https://github.com/wireapp/coax/tree/master/coax-client)**:
Client for Wire's HTTP API.

**[coax-actor](https://github.com/wireapp/coax/tree/master/coax-actor)**:
Higher level client which also utilises local storage and asynchronous
notifications over websockets.

**[coax-gtk](https://github.com/wireapp/coax/tree/master/coax-gtk)**:
A simplistic GUI to test the whole stack interactively.
